Understanding if entries in a dataset refer to the same real-world entity (i.e., entity matching -- EM) is a challenging task even for human experts.

State-of-the-art approaches based on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models are highly accurate but  suffer from low interpretability. From the user's perspective, these models act as oracles. This is a critical problem in many operational scenarios where traceability, scrutiny, and users' confidence in the model are fundamental requirements as well as the model accuracy.
