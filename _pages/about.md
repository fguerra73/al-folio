#### Short Bio

Francesco Guerra received his PhD in information engineering at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in 2004. Since November 2005, he works at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, before as Assistant Professor, from 2015 to 2022 as an Associate Professor, and since September 2022 as a Full Professor. He teaches Big Data Analysis and Software Engineering at the Department of Engineering “Enzo Ferrari”. His main research interests include integration of heterogeneous information sources (he has worked on the application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques to the Entity Resolution problem), semantic web (he has worked on the creation and alignment of ontologies), keyword based searches on structured datasets (he has worked on techniques for supporting keyword search on relational databases) and data mining and analytics on big data (he has worked on techniques for anomaly and novelty detection, for supporting machine learning techniques in production, and for providing explainable AI).

He participated in European and national projects. In particular, he coordinated the KEYSTONE COST Action, years 2013-2017, (IC 1302 KEYSTONE COST Action– Semantic Keyword Search on Structured Data Sources), that involved more than 250 researchers from 31 countries and the Re-search Alps (INEA/CEF/ICT/A2016/1296967) project, years 2017-2019, that aimed to gather, consolidate, harmonize and make available to different target groups (public and private bodies) data about laboratories and research and innovation centers active in the seven countries that constitute the Alpine Area. The Italian and French Research Ministry, the University of Milan, and the French Sidetrade company participated in the research. Francesco Guerra is part of the Program Committees of important conferences and workshops (SIGIR, CIKM, WSDM, KDD, …). He was Visiting Professor at the University of Rijeka in 2019. He is a visiting reviewer for the AI thesis at the University of Malta.
