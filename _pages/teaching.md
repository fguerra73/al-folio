## Ingegneria del Software (Software Engineering)
### Corso di Laurea Triennale in Ingegneria Informatica (Bachelor degree in Information Engineering)

#### Overview
Providing the fundamental knowledge of the models, languages and technologies for requirements specification, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance of software systems.

#### Course contents
The course will provide the main theoretical technological and applicative knowledge of the following phases in which the life cycle of a software system can be divided: requirement specifications, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance. In particular:

	1. Requirement specifications. 	
	**Theoretical part**: The specific goals of the requirements, the expected inputs and how to create 	specifications.
	**Application part**: Using the UML use case diagram for the representation of the requirements.

	2. Design
	**Theoretical part**: The objectives of the planning phase, the high-level design definition and detail. Examples of architectural styles. Functional decomposition. Object Relational Mapping: definition and issues. Defining the design quality characteristics. Introduction of metrics for software evaluation. Definition of cohesion and coupling of software modules.
	**Application part**: Use of UML diagrams for the description of the software. ORM: JPA and Hibernate. Use of design patterns for software design.

	3. Implementation, testing
	**Theoretical part**: Defining what it is meant by good planning and identification of best practices. Software refactoring. Software testing and code inspection. Survey of several testing techniques (Path Analysis, Boundary values analysis, ...).
	**Application part**: Junit: the framework for testing Java programs Overview of basic techniques of defensive programming Maven and Git programming support, and software management.

	4. Distribution and Maintenance
	**Theoretical part**: Description of the main problems associated with configuration management and post-production software. Types of software licenses.
